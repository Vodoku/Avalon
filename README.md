# Avalon
* * *
Welcome to project **Avalon**, a logistics AI training simulation.

This project plans to allow an AI to balance logistical requirements of a *perfect* city. Such a city would have an ever changing equipment of resources as well as an ever changing production of resources corresponding to its population. As in real life, unexpected events can occur causing a city to produce less resources than is required. It is the governing AI's responsibility to manage which other cities must overproduce for the city in distress balance various factors (distance, travel cost, etc.) to ensure the optimal choice is taken. 

It is worth noting this project is a work in progress and unlikely to build let alone work in its current state. Stay tuned for updates!

## Features
---
* Swappable governing AI's (Planned)
* Ease of simulating various sized logistical operations (In the works)

## Platforms
---
**Avalon** is designed to be cross platform and not require any platform specific code. However, few platforms are available for testing.

* Windows (In the works)
* Linux (Planned)
